%TRAIN Trains the spectral SVM based on the reference spectra
%   train() is a function in the Spectra Learner pipeline. It takes a matrix
%   of predictors, X, and a vector of class labels, Y. X is a p by q 
%   matrix, where p is the number of pixels and q is the number of spectral
%   bands, and Y is a p by 1 vector. A random selection of 0.75 of the data
%   is used to train a gaussian SVM. The trained model applied to the
%   remaining 0.25 of the data to create a confusion matrix. The confusion
%   matrix gives an idea of how well the model classifies correctly. The
%   resulting model and confusion matrix are returned.
%
%   Example:
%       [ mdl, confMat ] = train( X, Y )

%   Compatibility: Written and tested on MATLAB v9.0.0.341360 (2016a)
%   Required Toolboxes: Statistics and Machine Learning and Parallel
